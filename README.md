# Final-Project

## Pokedex: 

My Pokedex app contains the pokemon obtained from the poke Api as well as displaying their stats and color coordinated type. The app will also contain the pokemon listed in order by their National pokedex number. You will be able to locate specific pokemon by turning the pages in the prev and Next buttons on the right side of the pokedex. Then once selected you can see the pokemon's  attribute, type, weight, height, and name.
